What is this?
-------------

A rather silly modification for phpBB. A small image of Waldo [US] / Wally [UK] may appear somewhere on every page as you browse the board. Inspired by Xore's 2.x MOD CamelMOD.

Features
--------

*   A small image of Waldo [US] / Wally [UK] may appear somewhere on every page as you browse the board
*   The probability of finding Waldo is adjustable through the ACP
*   The size of the area in which Waldo can appear is also adjustable
*   If you have the Ultimate Points MOD installed, points will be awarded to a user who stumbles upon Waldo (configurable in the ACP of course)
*   You can set it so that clicking on the image of Waldo will lead you to another page (either within your domain or offsite)

Screenshots and demo
